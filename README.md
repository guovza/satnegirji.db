# satnegirji.db

SQLite database for suoma-sámi-suoma dictionary.

The satnegirji.db is the most up2date. satnegirji.csv is exported from the database every now and then.

If you downloaded a release package, you may replace the satnegirji.db file with the newer version to get all latest additions to the dictionary. 

Release packages are not updated very often, so if you want the latest dictionary database satnegirji.db or the latest satnegirji.csv file, grap them straight from this repository.

All the work is done with 0€. Please help and contribute. If you have new words or if you spot an error(s), please e-mail me skuolfi.relay980@passmail.net
